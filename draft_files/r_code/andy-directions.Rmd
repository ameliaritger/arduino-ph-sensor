```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

fit difference in temperature at each point 



the standard deviation of the temperature in the ICE bath and the 25C bath is what you want to calculate

subtract HOBO temp from Durafet temp, get standard deviation of that. do it for each temperature. 
are there significant differences between each temp.

that's my temperature uncertainty.

Take all my raw data and get the list of file names
```{r}

```

How much can temp change if R1 is at top of the range
```{r}

```
